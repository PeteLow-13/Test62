Pope, Captain William Talbot, and Cyrus Walker, and designed to look like their home of East Machias, Maine. The town is immaculately maintained, and a U.S. National Historic Landmark. The National Park Service called Port Gamble "the finest example of a nineteenth century Pacific Coast logging community.” Many of the historic homes are now shops.',
